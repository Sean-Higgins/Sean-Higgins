Hello, I’m Sean Higgins (GitHub ID: @Sean-Higgins).
I'm a Computer Science student with Autism Spectrum Disorder currently attending Oregon State University.

My interests include programming, microeletronics, mathematics, physics, and building models.
I’m currently learning discrete mathematics, linear algebra, and database design.
I'm also currently refreshing myself on many of my previously learned programming skills, including Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, and Assembly Language programming.
Aside from that, I have also been teaching myself other skills on my own time. I am teaching myself French through Duolingo and I taught myself the Bash scripting language
  through the Advanced Bash Scripting Guide. My next focus will be Algorithms, though the excellent (and free!) online textbook of the same name by Jeff Erickson.

I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but if that changes, I'll let you all know!
If you need to reach me for whatever reason, you can find my email address on my profile page. Please don't send spam.

With that out of the way, I hope you have a wonderful day!
